Assignment 1 :- Problem 2

1. mkdir Assignment2 --. i created directory inside LinuxAssignment 
2. cd Assignment2 --> then changed the directory
3. touch data.txt --> then created data.txt file 
4. cat > data.txt --> then pasted a multiple lines poem in it. i acciendtly put sapce in poem then had to remove the file and create new one 
5. head -n 10 data.txt --> to print first 10 lines poem inside data.txt
6. tail -n 5 data.txt --> to print last 5 lines of poem inside data.txt
7. touch numbers.txt --> created a file
8. cat > numbers.txt --> put series if 1 to 20 numbers inside file numbers.txt
9. head -15 numbers.txt --> displayed first 15 numbers. i messed up first time and put head 15 only and didn't get any output
10. touch input.txt --> created new txt file
11. cat > input.txt --> i put a lower case in it
12. tr '[:lower:]' '[:upper:]' < input.txt > output.txt --> all the lower case letters turned into upper case and store it in new output.txt file. i had to try this syntax for many time it took me around 20 min and 4-5 tries to figure it out
13. cat output.txt --> displayed the output file and it was coorect all letter were converted into upper case
14. touch duplicate.txt --> new txt file
15. cat > duplicate.txt --> i put some duplicate lines of poem in text file
16. uniq dunplicate.txt --> it displayed line in non drepeated/duplicate manner
17. touch fruit.txt --> new text file
18. cat > fruit.txt --> i added reapeated fruits name but not in consecative manner as i tried that before with  but had to try new commands 
19. sort fruit.txt | uniq -c | cut -c7- --> now in this command uniq -c works as count and gives sort sorts all fruits in dictionary manner and i had to add third pipe and put cut command but with specific c7 (i tried c5, c3,.....but c7 works )  it cuts 7 spaces given by output on each line.
